# **Abstract**
Candida albicans is a dimorphic fungus that is a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections in high-risk hospital units. Management of disseminated candida infections relies on a few antifungals, with Fluconazole being first-line therapy. The emergence of Fluconazole-resistant Candida strains highlights the need for improved molecular understanding of drug response. In this work we characterize the early transcriptional and posttranscriptional response of sensitive and resistant C. albicans in response to Fluconazole. Our work has previously shown in S. cerevisiae that mRNA degradation is connected to the translation process up to the degree that 5´-3´ mRNA degradation follows the last translating ribosome. Thus, the study of the 5'P mRNA degradome (5PSeq) offers a simple and affordable way to measure ribosome dynamics. Here, we expanded our 5PSeq work to Candida and show that it can be used to identify codon specific ribosome stalls in response to drugs and amino acid deprivation. Next, we use both RNA-Seq and 5PSeq to study the early response to fluconazole in sensitive and resistant strains. Our results suggest that transcriptional responses, rather than changes in ribosome dynamics, are the main driver of the earlier Candida response to fluconazole.
