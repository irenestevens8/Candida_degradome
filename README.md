# **Abstract**
Candida albicans is a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) in high-risk hospital units (e.g. neonatal and intensive care units (ICUs)). Management of candidemia relies on a few antifungal agents, with Fluconazole being safest and first line therapy. Here we show widespread co-translational decay occurs in Candida albicans and derive Fluconazole-specific degradation signatures. Furthermore, we show that ribosome positional occupancy at nucleotide-, amino acid- codon resolution provides a readout of Fluconazole-induced cellular stress. Finally, we show that frame protection patterns in signature genes are associated with phenotypic response to Fluconazole.
